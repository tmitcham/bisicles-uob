This branch of BISICLES includes developments for use with UKES<.
Updates include:
1. A new filetool called `meltDiagnsoticUKESM` which can be used to read fields from a file produced by the NEMO/BISICLES coupling scripts in UKESM and integrate it over domains of interest as the `diagnostics` filetool does

BISICLES is an adaptive mesh ice sheet model.

User documentation is in the docs directory and at https://ggslc.github.io/bisicles-uob/. Developer documentation is in the code/docs directory.

This repository begins with the version used to work on CalvingMIP (https://github.com/JRowanJordan/CalvingMIP). It has 
no history prior to that, because (a) there are many branches (b) the history includes files too large to be stored
on GitHub. It is possible that we will provide a full history repo at some point, but there are no concrete plans.
